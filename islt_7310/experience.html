                <h3>University of Missouri | General Studies | Fall 2015 – Spring 2020</h3>
                <p>After high school, I immediately went to get my degree at the University of Missouri - Columbia. I started off as Biochem major, but quickly decided I was more interested in the flexibility of a BS in general Biology. I worked part-time as a bartender and used that position to make connections that would later become an internship in Healthcare IT. Bartending was instrumental in helping me find a foothold in the working world, and has become my go-to recommendation for anyone who is having a hard time making connections.</p>
                <p>After a period of time I switched to online schooling to have more flexibility with my time, and I found that online schooling was a format that allowed me to thrive. This format let me work part time as a bartender, then as an intern, and finally at my current job as a paid search specialist. I was even able to switch majors and learn a few of the skills I had been wanting to learn in my final semester, which was incredibly satisying and fulfilling. I was frustrated by the lack of marketable skills that my degree had provided me, so learning HTML, CSS, Python, and 4 separate Adobe products in a single semester felt a lot like I was catching up on what I'd missed out on.</p>

                        <h2>IT Internship</h2>
                <h3>Cerner Corporation | Clinical Apps Intern | Apr 2019 – Jan 2020 </h3>
                <p>Cerner is a global leader in Electronic Medical Record; their suite of applications and programs support every aspect of maintaining the workflows within the hospital. As a Clinical Apps Intern, I learned the specifics of each role on the Clinical Apps Team and alleviated workloads when any given department had large-scale projects or just needed an extra set of hands.</p>
                <p>My primary assignment was working with ePrescribing software and maintaining the databases used to keep track of physicians and their permission levels. During this time, I made every effort to focus on learning the SQL-based language they used for their database management.</p>
                <p>Before hospitals transition over to Cerner software, there is a support team that travels a week in advance to help prepare physicians for the training they will receive. The main focus is ensuring their accounts and devices are properly configured, but It’s also important to communicate with physicians about their workflows and how they might streamline certain processes using Cerner’s software. </p>
                <p>While there, I also noted that it was sometimes difficult to understand the roles of everyone around me. I spent many of my spare moments compiling a guide for interns who filled in after me, so that they might have a smoother transition. </p>
                <p>It was an amazing experience that prepared me for the working world by showing me just how much I didn’t know. I got to work with so many people who constantly demonstrated what an expert in their field is capable of, and I think that was a very important experience for my career development.</p>

        <h2>Marketing Agency</h2>
        <h3>Caledon Virtual | Paid Search Specialist | Jan 2020 – Present</h3>
        <p>Caledon Virtual is a digital marketing company based out of Columbia, MO that offers a full catalog of marketing services to a variety of clients. My role as a paid search specialist is to monitor the performance of paid search accounts within the Google Ads platform. I also contribute to creating and monitoring social media ad campaigns on Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, and LinkedIn. I am able to contribute to SEO on a strategy implementation level, but I am currently learning to develop these strategies on my own as well.</p>
        <p>One of the things I like best about this job is getting to slow down and focus on accounts at a granular level. Being able to leverage years of account data to find trends and adjust accordingly is something that I’ve found very enjoyable. This job has shown me how much I enjoy fixing things and figuring out how things work, which I hadn’t realized was such a big part of my personality until now. I also value learning new skills very highly, and that is directly in line with the culture at Caledon; there is always room to add a new skill to your repertoire and coming to the team with your ideas about more effective ways of doing things is actively encouraged.</p>
        <p>A goal of mine that I would like to implement before the end of summer 2020 is to write a python script that is able to process an excel file of our performance data and return a list of accounts that need to be investigated. This could save me 3 hours of work every week, and also eliminate the chance that I miss something concerning.</p>
