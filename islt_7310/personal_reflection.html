        <h2>Early College</h2>
        <p>I spent most of my high school and college years convinced that I wanted to devote myself to learning about Biology, but as time went on, I found that I had a growing list of interests and no real time to learn them. I had assumed Biology would be a constant in my life without ever considering that it might be keeping from things I would enjoy much more. As difficult as it was to admit that I didn’t want to follow the roadmap I had created for myself, I quickly found that it made me more excited about the future than I had been in a long time. </p>

        <h2>Internship</h2>

        <p>I was very lucky in that I was able to find opportunity and pivot towards things that piqued my interest. I landed an internship in healthcare IT, which was my first real introduction to working culture and professional life. Being an intern was a unique perspective that I couldn’t appreciate until I experienced the reality of a full-time job; interns get to be a part of a company and team without anywhere near the amount of responsibility and stress that a normal employee would experience.</p>

        <p>Thanks to my internship, I got to focus on what I enjoyed about the work I was doing, without rolling deadlines and endless emails skewing my judgement. While those things are part of working life, it’s uncommon to have the freedom to explore different roles without having to pause and consider the time constraints it may place on your own workload. This horizontal mobility allowed me to try different things and identify my strengths, which has been instrumental in my development as a young professional. My internship wasn’t just good for slowly introducing me to the work force, it also helped me recognize the importance of enjoying the work you do and finding opportunities to thrive. </p>

        <h2>Work</h2>

        <p>From my internship I went into a full-time job as a search marketing specialist, a field for which I had very few qualifications. The reason I was drawn to this job is because of the sheer variety that any given day can bring. Marketing requires contributions from many different skillsets for even small tasks, and that is an excellent environment for finding opportunities for growth. I really think I’ll be able to learn a lot from it, and that’s something I really want from my job. I’m sure that I will continue to learn more about myself and the working world as time goes on, but as of now, these are the lessons and experiences that have shaped my career.</p>
