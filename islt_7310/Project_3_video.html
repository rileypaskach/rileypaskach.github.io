        <p>From this video, I hope that viewers consider the change that working from home has been for many of our pets. I also hope that they employ some of the methods I mention in my video for making their pets happy and content during the workday. <strong>Objective:</strong> Get others to make their pets happier and less disruptive while they work.</p>
        
    <h2 class= "col-4 mx-auto text-center">Licensing</h2>
    
    <p>My background music was "Miss You Love" by PatinÌƒo. I downloaded this from Youtube Audio Library, and this particular track has no attribution requirements or copyright, although I chose to give credit regardless. My "Pop" sound effect was downloaded from a collection of license-free sound effects for Adobe Audition.</p>   
    
    <div class="container col-lg-auto">
    <p>Here is a link to my <a href="docs/Module%204%20and%205%20Storyboard.pdf"> Storyboard </a> that I've uploaded to this repository.</p>
    </div>
        
    
        
    <h2 class= "col-4 mx-auto text-center">Techniques</h2>
        
    <p>I combined closeup shots and full shots when shooting my video, which was mainly to get close and offset the low-light as much as possible. I also had a couple ground-level shots that used the desktop as the ground and brought the viewer to Tinker's level. For movement, I used 2 pan shots to incorporate more character into the video, rather than just using all static shots. I included a push transition, a dissolve, and a split. I almost included a dutch angle, but I remembered Thor 2 and thought better of it.</p>
        
        
    <h2 class= "col-4 mx-auto text-center">Reflection</h2>
    
    <p>I like my video a lot, and I think it does a good job of taking on a sad problem in a good way. Nobody wants to think about sad pets, but addressing it directly with a bit of humor will let viewers/learners consider it without feeling attacked. I think this fits well into my project because it is somewhat useful, but also not totally devoted to being strictly about utility.</p>
