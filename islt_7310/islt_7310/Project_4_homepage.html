    <h2 class= "col-4 mx-auto text-center">Topic</h2>
        
        <p>This project is about the at-home workspace, and ways that one can go about making their work-from-home station more pleasant to use on a daily basis. By clicking on the speaker above, one can listen to an audio file that will address the purpose of this project as well. <strong>Learning Objective:</strong> Give those who work from home some ideas for how to improve their workspace.</p>
        
    <h2 class= "col-4 mx-auto text-center">Digital Media Principles</h2>
        
        <p> For this page, I organized a new photo that included elements from all of the media pieces I put together in this course. Using Genially, I was able to designate hotspots on that image for each type of media. Each of those hotspots link to my project pages, and each of those go more in-depth to the various techniques used to craft each piece of media, but I will go into an overview of the media principles behind each of those types of media.</p>
        
        <p>The purpose of my photoshopped image of the backlit monitors is to firmly illustrate the benefit of bias lighting by contrast. The purpose of the audio file is to explain why I chose work-from-home spaces as the subject of my website. The purpose of my video was to create a PSA for how the pandemic may be affecting our pets using video editing to highlight the adorable aspects of our pets.</p>
        
        <p>While my project may not function to instruct someone how to do something from start to finish, I think it does an excellent job of using each required medium to their fullest. For my photoshopped image, I chose to focus on a visual, but stagnant, aspect of my desk that I had wanted to incorporate. The bias lighting looks much better when contrasted directly with non-backlit screens. Since the second installment was an audio file, I knew that it would not function well to describe physical aspects of my workspace. Because of this, I used it to address any potential questions about why I would make a project on something so trivial. The final piece of media we needed to create was a video. Given that this is also very visual, I decided to plan and choreograph a collection of shots that simulated the many ways my cat is able to disrupt my workday. Since cats are adorable and dynamic, I knew that the subject was a great fit for a video.</p>
