            <h2 class="text-center">Who I Am</h2>

            <p>I am a Digital Marketing Strategist located in Philadelphia, PA. I live here with my long-time girlfriend, Alyssa Ripley, and my cat, Tinker. I have been in marketing for just over a year now, and I really enjoy being in such a dynamic field with so many different things to do. Digital marketing overlaps heavily with data analytics and web development, so I am always working to develop and improve my skills in those areas.

    <h2 class="text-center">What I Do</h2>
    <p>My job is to help connect people to the online audience they are trying to reach. The internet is a competitive landscape, and many people have a ton to offer the world if they could just gain enough traction to get started. There is nothing more gratifying than being able to bridge that gap and bring people the traffic they need. I have worked on paid and organic campaigns for clients of all types, and I have found that the process outlined below will reveal the leaky spots in any conversion funnel.</p>

      <h3 class="card-title">Identify Goals and Investigate Problems</h3>
        <p class="card-text">No matter the client, the first step will be to define what a <strong>"Conversion"</strong> looks like for them. Someone new to digital marketing might have no idea, but for experienced clients we may need to start off discussing what their online conversions look like in the real world, and how we can make adjustments to improve results. My next immediate step is to deep-dive into their <strong>Analytics</strong>. Conversion totals are the end of a long journey, and it's important to determine if anyone is getting lost along the way</p>

      <h3 class="card-title">Test Solutions</h3>
        <p class="card-text">This part is a bit more difficult to outline, even thematically. The variation of goals and current performance will mean that this part could be almost anything. <strong>SEO</strong> is always part of the solution because you should be working on your organic ranking at all times. If budget allows, there is always a <strong>Paid Search</strong> strategy that will help someone reach their goals. </p>

    <div class="card-body">
      <h3 class="card-title">Build on Momentum</h3>
        <p class="card-text">By analyzing site traffic data, I'll gain new insights that I'll use to further refine the overall marketing strategy. Each new iteration is an opportunity to learn more and improve on our digital marketing efforts. I will review Heatmaps and A/B tested pages, which are incredibly useful tools for <strong>CRO</strong>. I do things this way because I am able to avoid wasting both data and time; improvements ripple outward and feed into more improvements.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">About this site</h2>
        
            <p>I built this site by hand using Bootstrap. Since I won't need to make daily additions to the content, I think the built-in functionality of Bootstrap will be enough to meet the needs of this site. I'm hoping to keep my web dev skills sharp, but I also think it's much more rewarding to do it this way instead of using a CMS like Wordpress.</p>

            <p>Feel free to click around and visit the other pages on my site! I am always working on new projects, and I am still in the process of migrating previous projects from my computer to the website, so new stuff is getting added all the time!
