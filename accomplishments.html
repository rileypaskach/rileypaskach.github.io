    <h1>Professional Accomplishments</h1>
    <h2>Consultant Site Intern</h2>
    <p>In April 2019, I started an internship at <strong>Cerner</strong>, one of the Nationâ€™s leading providers of Electronic Medical Record. While there I worked mainly on ePrescribe, the ability for a provider to send scripts electronically instead of by fax or calling it in. I spent time working with other teams as well and tried to get a firm grasp of how the workflows operated. I used this understanding to create a guide to pass on to the interns who followed in my footsteps, so that they would have an easier time getting up to speed with the complicated system than I did.
        </p>
    <h2>Paid Search Specialist</h2>
    <p>In January 2020, I started a full-time job at <strong>Caledon Virtual</strong> as a paid search specialist. This job involves data-analysis and knowledge of how to create and monitor ad campaigns on Google's advertising networks. I have also taken on responsibilities related to management of social media presences for clients, with special efforts being made to increase efficiency wherever possible. Within a week, I had transitioned 25 clients from manual to automatic posting, effectively freeing up 3-4 hours per week. I'm a very detail-oriented person, and I enjoy improving/fixing things.
