     Hello all, my name is Riley. I am a full-time student at MU while also working a full-time digital marketing job here in Columbia. I spent a long time thinking I’d go into Biology for a living, but recently I decided that I wanted to pursue other interests as a career. I work with landing pages, domains, and web applications every day, so I’m hoping that this class will give me more insight into what I’m already doing, while also letting me do more on the development side of things. I’m currently also learning Python and have tried learning HTML in the past, but it wasn’t as applicable to me at that time and I didn’t stick with it. At the moment the only hobby I really have time for is playing video games, but when I have enough spare time on my hands I like to tinker with basic electronics like microcontrollers.
